This is a memory reliability testing tool, implemented by combining
http://limadriver.org/ and http://pyropus.ca/software/memtester/

Licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (only)
because the license of memtester applies to this work as a whole.

Compilation instructions:

    cmake .
    make -j2

Now you should have the lima-memtester static binary. Running it only
requires any Linux kernel with the mali400 kernel module version r3p2 or
older and a framebuffer driver (for example, the sunxi-3.4 kernel using
the default configuration satisfies these requirements). This test does
not depend on anything in the userland and should work with any Linux
distribution. It can be run with root privileges as:

    ./lima-memtester 100M

The usage is exactly the same as for the original memtester. The only
difference is that a spinning textured cube demo is simultaneusly
running in a separate thread. Earlier experiments with overclocking RAM
on Allwinner A10 and Allwinner A20 hardware have shown that Mali400
usually starts misbehaving first. Exposing faults, which are very
difficult to reproduce on CPU-only workloads.

lima-memtester-restarter.sh is included for testing dvfs/cpufreq problems.
On my system with incorrect voltage table this script crashed within a few
minutes. It uses the same syntax as lima-memtester but stops the demo
occasionally so that the cpu goes to idle state repatedly.

If the hardware is unstable (for example RAM is clocked too high), the
system may deadlock after running this test for a while. Or the test
may start showing the following error messages in the console:
